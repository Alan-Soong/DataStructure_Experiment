# DataStructure_Experiment

Here are my coding about the course of DSE (Data Structure Experiment). 

AWARE: In these files, **some errors probably existed**, please pay much attention on them. Don' t directly  use the magic of CV (doge face) ! 

10 experiments. Red_black_tree and the multiply of matrix via linked list are quite difficult among them. So, come on, guys! 

Try your best to code by yourself! AI can help a lot, but excessively depending on AI will weaken your capacity of coding! A little using I think is OK, COZ I just doing this, hhhh!
